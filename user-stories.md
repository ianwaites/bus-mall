#Marketing Research Team Story

As a part of the marketing research team, we want clear and concise data that tells us what products consumers are most interested, and what users would prefer if given a choice between 3 different products. This helps us track popularity and also what products to focus on. We want the user to have 3 choices, 25 times. We want to track what percentage of positive choices are made for each product, how many times a product is picked, and possibly the demographic of the person being surveyed.

#The Developer's Story

I want to create an app that can pick 3 pictures out of a set of pictures, and display them. The user should make a choice on which of those 3 they would like to purchase, and click on the picture to confirm their choice. After they click, the pictures should randomly pick new pictures, with the previous 3 choices being withheld. Pictures should not show up more than once per iteration. After the user clicks through and makes 25 individual choices, I want to stop the program, and display the choices they made to them. I also want to log all of this information for the Marketing Team. I need to figure out how to display and render this information through the DOM to make the interface more user friendly, and give them a sense of accomplishment after they finish the survey.

#Focus Group Participants.

Alfred, 19, Single Male. He wants a clean and professional site with a good looking layout. He won't want a lot of handholding, he's very familiar with technology, he's on the internet most of the day. He wants to be able to speed through his choices and he wants low load times.

Brandon,38, Married. Brandon is just doing this for fun, he wants to see cool products. He's familiar with how websites look, and would need instruction on how to input his choices if the website is too busy. Otherwise, he's not going to have trouble with simple instruction.

Cheryl, 62, Widowed. Cheryl is interested that her opinion is wanted and valued by our Marketing Research Team. She's not as familiar with how interfaces work, so she needs detailed instructions on how to make sure her choice has been made, and she needs confirmation that she did the right thing. She's excited to participate, and it's up to us to accommodate her needs.
